# honestybox-measurement

A framework for measuring things and producing structured results.

## Requirements

`honestybox-measurement` supports Python 3.5 to Python 3.8 inclusively.


## Releases

To ensure releases are always built on the latest codebase, *changes are only ever merged from master*.

### Creating a release
1. Ensure that master is up to date:

    ```shell script
    git checkout master
    git pull origin
    ```

2. Switch to release and ensure it is up to date:

    ```shell script
    git checkout release
    git pull origin
    ```

3. Merge from master:

    ```shell script
    git merge master
    ```

4. Add a new release to CHANGELOG.md and include all changes in [Unreleased].

5. Update version number in `pyproject.toml`

6. Commit the changes to the `release` branch with comment `Release <version number>`

    ```shell script
    git add CHANGELOG.md pyproject.toml
    git commit -m 'Release 0.0.1`
    ```

7. Tag the commit with the release number:

    ```shell script
     git tag 0.0.1
    ```

8. Push the commit and tags upstream:

    ```shell script
    git push && git push --tags
    ```

9. Merge changes into master and push upstream:

    ```shell script
    git checkout master
    git merge release
    git push
    ```


### Publishing a release

1. Install [poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io) 

2. Checkout the release:

    ```shell script
    git checkout 0.0.1
    ```

3. Publish the release:

    ```shell script
    poetry publish --build
    ```
